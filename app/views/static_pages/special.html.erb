	<ul>
		<li> Suppose $\gamma$ is a piecewise smooth curve that does not pass through 
			any zeros or poles of $f(z).$ Suppose also that $f(z)$
			does not have any essential singularities.
			\[
			\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz = N - M = v(f(\gamma), 0),
			\]
			where $N$ is the number of zeros of $h(z)$ (including multiplicities)
			inside $\gamma$ and $M$ is the number of poles (again, including multiplicities).

		<li> One of its uses is to prove Rouche's Theorem.

		<li>
			<b>Rouche's Theorem</b>:
			If $f$ and $g$ are analytic complex functions on an open set 
			which contains a piecewise smooth simple closed curve $\gamma$,
			and $|g(z)| < |f(z)|$ for all $z\in \gamma$, then
			$f+g$ has the same number of zeros inside $\gamma$ as $f$ 
		</li>
		<li>
			This theorem is reall powerful. It can be used to prove the
			fundamental theorem of algebra (that there are exactly $n$ roots
			of polynomial of degree $n$ on the complex number field).

	<ul>
		<li> The conditions are the following:
		<ul>
			<li> Suppose that the only singularities
				of $f(z)$ in the finite $z$ plane are the simple
				poles at $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, $
				arranged in order of increasing moduli.
			</li>
			<li>
				Let the residues of $f(z)$ at
				$a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, $ be 
				$b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots.$
			</li> 
			<li> Let $C_N$ be circles of radius $R_N$ which
				do not pass through any poles and on which
				$|f(z)| < M$, where $M$ is independent of $N$
				and $R_N\to \infty$ as $N\to \infty.$ 
			</li>
		</ul>
		Then,
		\[
			f(z) = f(0) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n
			\left\{
			\frac{1}{z-a_n} -
			\frac{1}{a_n}
			\right\}
		\]

	<ul>
		<li> Let $(z_m)$, $m\in \mathbb{N}$ be an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers different from $0$,arranged by increasing moduli, and $\lim_{m\to \infty} = \infty$.
		Then there exists $\nu\in \N$ such that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty |z_j|^{-\nu + 1}$
		converges uniformly and for 
		\[Q_{\nu}(z) = z + \frac{z^2}{2} + \cdots +\frac{z^\nu}{\nu},\nu\geq 1,Q_0(z) = 0,\]
		and for arbitrary entire function $g(z),$
		\[
			G(z) := e^{g(z)}z^m \prod_{j=1}^\infty 
			\left(1 - \frac{z}{a_j}\right) \exp\left({Q_\nu\left(\frac{z}{a_j}\right)}\right)
		\]
		is an entire function with a zero 
		of multiplicity $m$ at $z = 0$ and
		with the other zeros exactly at $a_j.$

		<li> One of its cool results:
			\[
				\frac{2}{1}\cdot
				\frac{2}{3}\cdot
				\frac{4}{3}\cdot
				\frac{4}{5}\cdot
				\frac{6}{5}\cdot
				\frac{6}{7}\cdots
				= \frac{\pi}{2}
