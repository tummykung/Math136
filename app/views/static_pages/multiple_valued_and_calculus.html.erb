	Note that the definition is the same as in the real case.
	The difference is that the limit is much stronger, because
	it comes from all possible paths.
	<ul>
		<li>
			Def: $\lim_{z\to z_0}f(z) = w_0$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$,
			there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $0 < |z - z_0| < \delta$
			($z$ in a punctured, open disc) implies 
			$|f(z) - w_0| < \epsilon.$

	<ul>
		<li>
			Again, same definition.
			\[
				f'(z_0) = \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z_0 + \Delta z) - f(z_0)}{\Delta z}.
			\]
		</li>

		<li>
			Def: The function $f(z)$ is said to be <em>differentiable</em>
			at $z = z_0$ if the limit above exists.
		</li>
